# Tiny VM

The Tiny VM (TVM) is a simplified P-machine. 
The P-machine is described in the book by 
Reinhard Wilhelm (Compiler Design, Addison-Wesley, 1995).
Another version of P-machine, namely GP-machine, is available in GitHub: [GP-machine](https://github.com/xdevroey/GPMachine). 

### How to Build

Just use `make.bat` in Windows with GCC (g++).

```
make
```

## Getting Started

Invoke `tvm` with a TVM byte code, say `hello.t`.

```
tvm hello.t
```

## TVM sample codes

The directory `sample.t` contains several sample TVM codes.
